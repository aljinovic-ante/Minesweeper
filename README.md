# Minesweeper
Simple Minesweeper console game in C++

Mini console game, no known bugs but may have some.
May be upgraded in some fields:
1. More user-friendly => user sets height, length and number of mines, etc.
2. Better partial board reveal, more similar to real minesweeper (revealing the connected portion of the board).
